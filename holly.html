   <p>My webpage is all about the seabin, a floating rubbish bin that is located in the water at marinas, docks, yacht clubs and commercial ports. </p>
   
   <p>The seabin moves up and down with the range of tide collecting all floating rubbish. Water is sucked from the surfaceand passes through a catch bag inside the seabin. With a submersible water pumpcapable of displacing 25,000 litres per hour plugged directly into 110/220 V outlet. The water is then pumped back into the marina leaving litter and debris trapped to be disposed</p>
